## Task Checklist

### Developer

- [ ] I am the original author or an authorized maintainer of this plugin.
- [ ] I have complied with all license requirements for the libraries used, including providing appropriate notices where necessary.
- [ ] My plugin is entirely FOSS and doesn't rely on any external paid services provided (unless incredibly well known and trusted, and you or anyone you know doesn't profit on it).  

### Plugin Functionality

- [ ] I have tested the plugin on both the **Stable** and **Beta** SteamOS update channels.

### Backend Configuration

* **Yes/No**: I use a standard Millennium python backend in my plugin.
* **Yes/No**: I use **custom binaries** that or rely on other FOSS projects that aren't written directly using Millennium's python backend. 

### Community Contribution

<!--  
  Link to your feedback on two plugin PRs in a comment on this PR.  
  This step is optional but strongly encouraged â€” plugin PRs without testing contributions may be reviewed more slowly.  
-->

- [ ] I have tested and left feedback on **two** other plugin pull requests.
- [ ] I have added links to those feedback comments in this PR.
