  ðŸ“Œ **Before You Submit: Please Read Carefully**

  This template is **only** for submitting a **new plugin** to the store.  
  If you're doing anything else (e.g., updating a plugin), please start over and select the appropriate PR template.

  Make sure you have:
  - (Optional, Highly encouraged) Tested and left feedback on **two other plugin PRs**.
  - Replaced **REPLACE_WITH_PLUGIN_NAME** and **REPLACE_WITH_SUMMARY**.
  - Completed the **Task Checklist**, including all Yes/No questions.

# REPLACE_WITH_PLUGIN_NAME

<!--  
  Briefly describe what your plugin does.  
  If relevant, include screenshots, videos, or comparisons to similar plugins.  
  If your plugin overlaps with existing ones, explain how it differs and why it adds value.

REPLACE_WITH_SUMMARY



## Task Checklist

### Developer

- [ ] I am the original author or an authorized maintainer of this plugin.
- [ ] I have complied with all license requirements for the libraries used, including providing appropriate notices where necessary.
- [ ] My plugin is entirely FOSS and doesn't rely on any external paid services provided (unless incredibly well known and trusted, and you or anyone you know doesn't profit on it).  

### Plugin Functionality

- [ ] I have tested the plugin on both the **Stable** and **Beta** SteamOS update channels.
- [ ] My plugin is **unique**, or provides **additional or alternative functionality** to plugins already on the store.

### Backend Configuration

* **Yes/No**: I use a standard Millennium python backend in my plugin.
* **Yes/No**: I use **custom binaries** that or rely on other FOSS projects that aren't written directly using Millennium's python backend. 

### Community Contribution

<!--  
  Link to your feedback on two plugin PRs in a comment on this PR.  
  This step is optional but strongly encouraged â€” plugin PRs without testing contributions may be reviewed more slowly.  
-->

- [ ] I have tested and left feedback on **two** other plugin pull requests.
- [ ] I have added links to those feedback comments in this PR.
